## Web-Application-for-analyzing-Restaurant-Market-Health-Data
# Description
For delivering superior restaurant experience to the public, I have designing a web application which let users search for the best restaurants in LA from 26,000 restaurants, based on an algorithm that used hygiene, taste, experience, etc., as input. The application features a dashboard for the Restauranteurs to track and analyze their ratings based on past Health inspections and Surveys Database with 4,000,000 tuples.
